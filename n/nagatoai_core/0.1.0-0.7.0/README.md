 Nagato-AI is an intuitive AI Agent library that works across multiple LLMs.
 
 Currently it supports OpenAI's GPT and Anthpropic's Claude LLMs. You can create agents from any of the aforementioned family of models and combine them together to build the most effective AI Agent system you desire.
 
 The name _Nagato_ is inspired from the popular anime Naruto. In Naruto, Nagato is a very powerful ninja who possesses special eyes (Rinnegan) that gives him immense powers.

+## Tool calling
+
+Check the full example [here](docs/examples/coordinator_researcher_critic.py) to see how tool calling works.
+We now support tool calling for  GPT, Claude 3, and Llama 3 (via Groq) models.
+
+
+### Tool creation
+
+Creating a tool is straightforward. You must create have these two elements in place for a tool to be usable:
+
+1. A config class that contains the parameters that your tool will be called with
+2. A tool class that inherits from `AbstractTool`, and contains the main logic for your tool.
+
+For instance the below shows how we've created a tool to get the user to confirm yes/no in the terminal
+
+```python
+from typing import Any, Type
+
+from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
+from rich.prompt import Confirm
+
+from nagatoai_core.tool.abstract_tool import AbstractTool
+
+
+class HumanConfirmInputConfig(BaseModel):
+    """
+    HumanConfirmInputConfig represents the configuration for the HumanConfirmInputTool.
+    """
+
+    message: str = Field(
+        ...,
+        description="The message to display to the user to confirm whether to proceed or not",
+    )
+
+
+class HumanConfirmInputTool(AbstractTool):
+    """
+    HumanConfirmInputTool represents a tool that prompts the user to confirm whether to proceed or not.
+    """
+
+    name: str = "human_confirm_input"
+    description: str = (
+        """Prompts the user to confirm whether to proceed or not. Returns a boolean value indicating the user's choice."""
+    )
+    args_schema: Type[BaseModel] = HumanConfirmInputConfig
+
+    def _run(self, config: HumanConfirmInputConfig) -> Any:
+        """
+        Prompts the user to confirm whether to proceed or not.
+        :param message: The message to display to the user to confirm whether to proceed or not.
+        :return: A boolean value indicating the user's choice.
+        """
+        confirm = Confirm.ask("[bold yellow]" + config.message + "[/bold yellow]")

 # What's next
 
 Nagato is still in its very early development phase. This means that I am likely to introduce breaking changes over the next iterations of the library.
 
 Moreover, there is a lot of functionality currently missing from Nagato. I will remedy this over time. There is no official roadmap per se but I plan to add the following capabilities to Nagato:
 
-* introduction of tools (e.g. surfing the web)
-* support for function calling (complement to adding tools)
-* support for other LLMs beyond OpenAI's and Anthropic's
-* short/long-term memory for agents
-* LLMOps instrumentation
+* âœ… implement function calling (complement to adding tools)
+* âœ… introduce basic tools (e.g. surfing the web)
+* âœ… Support for Llama 3 (via Groq)
+* ðŸŽ¯ cache results from function calling
+* ðŸŽ¯ implement short/long-term memory for agents (with RAG and memory synthesis)
+* ðŸŽ¯ implement self-reflection and re-planning for agents
+* ðŸŽ¯ implement additional modalities (e.g. image, sound, etc.)
+* ðŸŽ¯ Support for local LLMs (e.g. via Ollama)
+* ðŸŽ¯ LLMOps instrumentation

Summarize each response to capture the essence of the mother's interests, needs, and preferences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  â”‚

 Nagato-AI is an intuitive AI Agent library that works across multiple LLMs.
 
 Currently it supports OpenAI's GPT and Anthpropic's Claude LLMs. You can create agents from any of the aforementioned family of models and combine them together to build the most effective AI Agent system you desire.
 
 The name _Nagato_ is inspired from the popular anime Naruto. In Naruto, Nagato is a very powerful ninja who possesses special eyes (Rinnegan) that gives him immense powers.

 Assuming your program's entrypoint is defined in a file called `main.py`, you can run it by typing the following command:

+Nagato currently supports the following LLMs

 Nagato is built with flexibility at its core, so you could program it using your paradigm of choice. However these are some of the ways I've seen people use Nagato so far.

+### Tool creation
+
+Creating a tool is straightforward. You must create have these two elements in place for a tool to be usable:
+
+1. A config class that contains the parameters that your tool will be called with
+2. A tool class that inherits from `AbstractTool`, and contains the main logic for your tool.
+
+For instance the below shows how we've created a tool to get the user to confirm yes/no in the terminal
+
+```python
+from typing import Any, Type
+
+from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
+from rich.prompt import Confirm
+
+from nagatoai_core.tool.abstract_tool import AbstractTool
+
+
+class HumanConfirmInputConfig(BaseModel):
+    """
+    HumanConfirmInputConfig represents the configuration for the HumanConfirmInputTool.
+    """

+    message: str = Field(
+        ...,
+        description="The message to display to the user to confirm whether to proceed or not",
+    )

+
+class HumanConfirmInputTool(AbstractTool):

 # What's next
 
 Nagato is still in its very early development phase. This means that I am likely to introduce breaking changes over the next iterations of the library.
 
 Moreover, there is a lot of functionality currently missing from Nagato. I will remedy this over time. There is no official roadmap per se but I plan to add the following capabilities to Nagato:
 
-* introduction of tools (e.g. surfing the web)
-* support for function calling (complement to adding tools)
-* support for other LLMs beyond OpenAI's and Anthropic's
-* short/long-term memory for agents
-* LLMOps instrumentation
+* âœ… implement function calling (complement to adding tools)
